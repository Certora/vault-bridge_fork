ERC4626 - all                           DONE
VBT.Token == yieldVault.Token
roles are never zero. (admin, owner, recepient, rebalancer, pauser...)
only one address can have the role ??
minimumReservePercentage <= 1e18        DONE
yieldVault != 0
totalAssets == deposited + reserve should only decrease via withdraw, redeem    DONE
reservePercentage() <= 100% ..??
_simulateWithdraw(x, true) == x or revert       DONE
reservedAssets must be up-to-date when calling _simulateWithdraw (how do we check this efficiently ?)
reserve should never end up being unbalanced after a public method / an invariant..?
intergrity of public methods
integrity of pausing (cannot change anything while paused)                           DONE
"non reentrant" is checked for all public methods
_withdrawFromYieldVault(x, exact=true, ...) == (_, x)   DONE

solvencyCheck should hold at all times. the checks:
---------------------
Math.mulDiv(
    convertToAssets(originalTotalSupply + originalUncollectedYield) - originalReservedAssets,
    burnedYieldVaultShares, assets) 
    <= 
Math.mulDiv(yieldVaultSharesBalanceBefore, 1e18 + $.yieldVaultMaximumSlippagePercentage, 1e18),
---------------------
Math.mulDiv(
    convertToAssets(totalSupply() + yield()) - reservedAssets(), 
    burnedYieldVaultShares, maxWithdraw_)
    <= 
Math.mulDiv($.yieldVault.balanceOf(address(this)), 1e18 + $.yieldVaultMaximumSlippagePercentage, 1e18);
---------------------
solvencyCheckPassed = stakedAssets() - oldStakedAssets
    >= 
Math.mulDiv(assets, 1e18 - $.yieldVaultMaximumSlippagePercentage, 1e18);
---------------------

preview_ never reverts
preview_ is pesimistic for the user     DONE
max_ provide tight bounds, i.e. maxF == x => F(x) will not revert and F(x+1) will revert
methods dont revert even when convertToAssets is not an identity (e.g. check redeem)

rebalance doesn't affect totalAssets        DONE

what is lxlyBridge.claimAsset supposed to do?? change some balances?
    let's verify this individually and assume it later
_rebalanceReserve( force=true) => reserve is balanced afterwards

_depositIntoYieldVault increases stakedAssets(), i.e., increases yieldVault.balanceOf(this), DONE

yieldVault.balanceOf(this) cannot increase by more that minimumYieldVaultDeposit via a single call (as long as it was balanced before)

_withdrawFromYieldVault decreases stakedAssets()        DONE
